        <p>
          <strong>Hello, I'm Nageri Ibrahim Damilola</strong> – a Frontend
          developer passionate about creating meaningful and user-centered web
          applications. With a background in Library and Information Science
          from the University of Ilorin, I bring a unique perspective to tech,
          blending research and analytical skills with hands-on experience in
          coding and development. <br /><br />My approach to development focuses
          on understanding user needs and designing applications that are both
          functional and aesthetically pleasing. <br /><br />
          Throughout my journey in tech, I’ve developed a versatile skill set,
          ranging from <em>Frontend</em> technologies like <em>HTML</em>,
          <em>CSS</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>React</em>, and
          <em>Tailwind</em>, to <em>Backend</em> skills in <em>Python</em> and
          <em>SQL</em>. During my recent internship with HNG, I gained hands-on
          experience developing an e-commerce application. In this project, I
          utilized API integration to create a dynamic user experience, further
          enhancing my skills in building responsive, data-driven web
          applications. <br /><br />Beyond formal projects, I enjoy working on
          side projects like landing pages and other UI components, which allow
          me to experiment with new design ideas and frameworks. These side
          projects help me stay updated with the latest trends in UI/UX design,
          ensuring that I can create interfaces that are both visually appealing
          and highly functional.<br /><br />
          Driven by a commitment to continuous learning and improvement, I am
          excited to collaborate on innovative projects that make a difference.
          I am actively seeking opportunities to expand my expertise, solve
          complex problems, and contribute to meaningful tech solutions. Let’s
          connect and create something amazing together!
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:</p>

        <h4>Backend</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>

        </ul>

          <li>Leadership</li>
          <li>Time Management</li>
        </ul> -->
        <p>
          As a developer, I combine my technical skills with a commitment to
          high-quality code and design. I take pride in creating seamless,
          responsive, and visually appealing interfaces.
